# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

We need to apply an exploratory analysis through different vizualizations on some large datasets from a company named Pyber. We will be working with two libraries Pandas and Matplotlib to tell a compelling story about this data.

## Results:

As we can see in the summary below, it's interesting seeing how due to supply and demand the **Total Rides** for **Urban Cities** have the highest volume of rides out of the three city types, with 1,625 rides. However, the **Average Fer per Driver**, for this same city type has the lowest average fare with $16.57.

On the other hand, the **Rural City** types, have the lowest **Total Rides** score with 125 events, but have the highest **Average Fare per Driver** with $55.48.

In the chart below, we can observe that the sum of the weeky fare for the Urban Cities is around $2,000, for the Suburban Cities oscillates around $1,000 and finally for the Rural Cities is below the $500 for the year 2019

## Summary:

As we can see in the Bubble chart below, the Rural City types have the highest Average Fare per Ride, which could be indicating that these drivers are traveling longer distances than the drivers in the Urban and Suburban City types, and possible resulting in a loss in rides. Therefore, it is important to consider increase the number of drivers in the Rural cities to meet the rides demand.

However, further information is required because it could also indicate that there is no enough demand of these services due to lack of internet coverage or other issues releated.

It would be also interesting that in the Urban and Suburban areas explore the 'last mile' and food deliveries to increase the income and  profit streams for Pyber.
